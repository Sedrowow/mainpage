<ul>  
	<li>
		Out on the wiley, windy moors
	</li>
	<li>
		We'd roll and fall in green.
	</li>
	<li>
		You had a temper like my jealousy:
	</li>
	<li>
		Too hot, too greedy.
	</li>
	<li>
		How could you leave me,
	</li>
	<li>
		When I needed to possess you?
	</li>
	<li>
		I hated you. I loved you, too.
	</li>
	<li>
		Bad dreams in the night.
	</li>
	<li>
		They told me I was going to lose the fight,
	</li>
	<li>
		Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering
	</li>
	<li>
		Wuthering Heights.
	</li>
	<li>
		Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy.
	</li>
	<li>
		Come home. I'm so cold!
	</li>
	<li>
		Let me in-a-your window.
	</li>
	<li>
		Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy.
	</li>
	<li>
		Come home. I'm so cold!
	</li>

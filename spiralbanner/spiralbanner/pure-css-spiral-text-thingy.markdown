Pure CSS Spiral Text Thingy
---------------------------
Pure CSS recreation of the interval credits animation in End of Evangelion. Not very flexible at the moment.

Kinda janky in mobile devices, view in full screen.

The demo uses 16 elements, in a looped animation.

To adjust the space between elements, tinker with the `animation-delay` value of elements. But it can only do so much since the space between elements is also affected by the height of the elements' parent.
